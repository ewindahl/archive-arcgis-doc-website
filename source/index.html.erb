<p>This website contains the home & doc pages for the ready-to-use apps that are available to the ArcGIS.com organizational subscriber. These pages are presented in the same UI as ArcGIS.com. </p>

<p>On PRD, this specific page/URL does not exist. Instead it redirects to the ArcGIS.com about page, <a href="http://www.arcgis.com/about/">http://www.arcgis.com/about/</a></p>

<p>This site will deploy in late June 2013 in conjunction with the matching ArcGIS.com update. </p>
